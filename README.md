# My Dotfiles

Here is the technique I use to automate setting up my dev environment in mac using dotfiles while keeping it up-to-date.

It's all based of the Makefile.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sayanarijit/.files && cd .files && make
```

## Sync

```bash
dotsync
```

Or

```bash
make sync
```
